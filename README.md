2. Project Overview
-----------------------

The **[Instant Meal Suggestion App]** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the [HMAW0501] subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary 
 purpose is to [provide meal suggestion to the user according to the time of day, the app is developed to make food choice easy for the individual so they can have right food according to the time of day].

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.
```

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------
### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to [provide right meal suggestion to the users so that they can maintain a healty lifestyle by eating specific healty meal suggested by the app]. 

### Key Features:
- Feature 1: ["the app has a reset button ,in case if the user enters wrong day of time they don`t have to restart the app they can just use the reset button to clear the text and the provided meal suggestion. 
              after that user can enter correct day of time"]
- Feature 2: [if a invalid time of day is input the app does not crash it gives a error and and asks the user to input correct time of day"]
- Feature 3: ["on every meal suggestion the app provides two meal options to the users so that they can select the meal according to their personal prefrence"]

These features aim to provide [an easy-to-use platform for the users making it more reailable for everyday use].
```

4. Design Considerations
------------------------



The design of the **[Instant Meal Suggestion App]** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**: The app was designed with the goal of providing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: The app was built to ensure it performs well on different screen sizes, with particular attention to device compatibility.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage.
```

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.
```

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------
During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: [i have used a LinearLayout in xml and adding exit and reset buttion in constraintlayout was challenging because it was giving majour errors making the buttions disappear from app and unable 
                     to function in a constraintlayout"]
   - **Solution**: [ i tried to change the whole layout again but it still didn`t work so i researched deeply on the issue and found that there was some components missing which was not allowing the buttions to 
                    work in constraintlayout after adding the missing components the buttons started to work perfectly and the app was woking with functional buttions]
   
2. **Challenge 2**: [adding the background picture was challenging because if a dark colour backgroud is added it use to make the text difficult to read]
   - **Solution**: [after trying with 4 pictures i finally found the right background which was simple , in a light colour , and resolving the problem of text not being visible with background image]

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in debugging, using version control, and automating build processes with GitHub Actions.
```

8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **Feature 1**: [a spinner function for the input text so that the user dosen`t need to type the time of day, user can just scroll and select right time of day"]
2. **Feature 2**: [pictue for each suggested meal]
3. **Feature 3**: [Adding a dark mode option for better user experience]
4. **Feature 4**: [notification of meal time so the user dosen`t miss any meal in their busy routine]

These enhancements would improve the app’s usability and make it even more versatile for end-users.
